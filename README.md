CREDIT CARD DEFAULT PREDICTION AND BEHAVIOUR SCORING USING MACHINE LEARNING

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a high-performance machine learning system to identify high-risk customers by analyzing financial, transactional, and credit-bureau data. It includes thorough data exploration, advanced missing-value imputation, engineered feature creation, imbalance handling, and the evaluation of multiple models—ultimately delivering an optimized ensemble classifier capable of reliably detecting potential defaults or non-compliance cases.

Key Steps:

1. Data Understanding & EDA
- Explored 140K+ records across on-us, transaction, and bureau attributes.
- Identified missing values, outliers, and key correlated behavioral features.

2. Missing Value Imputation
- Compared MICE and MCMC.
- MCMC chosen for better multivariate consistency.

3. Feature Engineering
- AutoFE-based transformations, PCA, and interaction features.
- Feature ranking via ANOVA F-test + RFE.
- Final: 282 optimized features.

4. Class Imbalance Handling
- Tested SMOTE, ADASYN, Tomek Links, NearMiss, and no sampling.
- Best approach: No sampling + Logit Shift, threshold tuned using Youden’s J.

5. Modeling

- Models trained: XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees.
- Best model: Voting Classifier
- Performance:
  a.) ROC-AUC: 0.7832
  b.) Recall: 0.23
